## [Day 37 - Habit Tracker](https://github.com/Jared-Glenn/100-Days-of-Python/tree/main/Days%2026-50/037_habit_tracker)
* Accessed a tracking API, created graphs with it, and learned to add, change, and delete aspects of that graph.
* (Beyond the lesson) I also created a GUI that allows the user to quickly change the graph to the desired quantities.
* "Labbit" helps users track their goals and habits to improve their own behavior.

## [Day 36 - Stock News Tracker](https://github.com/Jared-Glenn/100-Days-of-Python/tree/main/Days%2026-50/036_stock_news)
* This program compares today's opening price of your chosen stock (default: Tesla) with its opening price yesterday.
* If there is a 5% difference in price between the two days, the program locates relevant news articles and formats them for ease of use.
* Articles are then sent to the user's phone via text message, along with the percent change since the previous day.
