## [Day 75 - Qualities of Successful Apps on the Android App Store](https://github.com/Jared-Glenn/100-Days-of-Python/tree/main/Days%2051-75/075_qualities_of_successful_apps_on_the_android_app_store)
* Analyzed the composition of the app store to determine the general qualities of success there.
* Discovered that the vast majority of apps are free with a large potential of significant lost installations if the app is paid.
* Among the more successful paid apps, Parenting, Weather, Medical, and Personalization had a much higher ratio of paid apps and tended to fetch higher prices.
* The median price of an app is $2.99, but some app markets have a much higher tolerance for expensive apps, such as Dating and Games, which can range up to about $6.00.

## [Day 74 - Google Trends and Correlation with Market Behavior](https://github.com/Jared-Glenn/100-Days-of-Python/tree/main/Days%2051-75/074_google_trends_and_correlation_with_market_behavior)
* Performed an analysis of data about the stock prices of Tesla and Bitcoin to determine if search trends preceded a rise in stock price.
* Overall, the analysis indicates that the variables have the reverse relationship. In fact, it appears that a rise in stock price tends to increase google searches done on the company.
* Also analyzed if searches for unemployment benefits historically precede a rise in unemployment.
* This did turn out to be prescient. There is a slight lead in benefits searches immediately before a rise in unemployment. This may be due to employees being aware of layoffs in advance, or it could be due to unemployment rates being calculated after a delay, of necessity.

## [Day 73 - Lego Popularity and Historical Set Growth and Themes]()
* Analyzed the growth of Lego products from its humble beginnings to its more recent growth. While sets started small, simple, and few, they have since grown on all fronts.
* Determined that, not only has the number of sets grown fairly steadily since 1949, but the complexity of the sets has also grown, as exemplified by the number of pieces per Lego set.
* Merged databases to discover the popularity of set themes. The most popular were Star Wars, Friends, and Ninjago. That said, Lego "gear" - that is, clothing, bags, etc. - , key chains, and books are also very popular "sets."

## [Day 72 - Popularity of Programming Languages by Month and Year](https://github.com/Jared-Glenn/100-Days-of-Python/tree/main/Days%2051-75/072_popularity_of_programming_languages)
* Used data generated by Stack Overflow language tags to determine trends in language usage.
* Manipulated the data to be more workable, such as altering the date column to a datetime column. Also created columns just for year and month, as needed.
* Created a Pivot Table to compare posts of different languages over time.
* Found a trend that moved from C# in 2008-2012, then to Javascript in 2015-2018, and finally to Python in 2020.

## [Day 71 - College Majors vs. Yearly Salary Analysis](https://github.com/Jared-Glenn/100-Days-of-Python/tree/main/Days%2051-75/071_majors_vs_salary)
* Practiced working with Pandas and Google Collaboratory to analyze the effects of a persons college major on their eventual yearly salary.
* Evaluated and found that Education and Spanish were the two lowest paid professions two years ago. Economics had a highly unstable payscale, with a wide spread of possible salaries.
* Found newer data, used data scraping to pull the data off of [Payscale.com](https://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report/majors-that-pay-you-back/bachelors), created a csv, and analyzed the more recent data to find that Political Economy had the lowest pay of the number I sampled.

## [Day 50 - Tinder Swiper](https://github.com/Jared-Glenn/100-Days-of-Python/tree/main/Days%2026-50/050_tinder_swiper)
* Created a program to swipe on tinder (like or dislike, by user choice) for a set of 100 other users.
* Uses Selenium to automate the login and authentication methods. Then simulates a swipe by a user to the right or left every 5 seconds.
* This particular build opts NOT to select "like" to avoid hurting feelings, instead selecting the "Nope" option and continuing to the next Tinder user.
* Note: The other user is not informed of "Nope" responses, making this the kindest option (in my opinion).
