## [Day 35 - Rain Alert](https://github.com/Jared-Glenn/100-Days-of-Python/tree/0.35/Days%2026-50/035_rain_alert)
- Created a program that will check the weather report each day to determine if it will rain in the next 24 hours.
- If rain is detected, a text message will be generated and sent to the user.
- Time of both the text and the hours checked can be customized for the user.
