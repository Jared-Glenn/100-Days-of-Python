# 100 Days of Python
Code completed in 2022 Bootcamp with Dr. Angela Yu.


## [Day 36 - Stock News Tracker](https://github.com/Jared-Glenn/100-Days-of-Python/tree/main/Days 26-50/036_stock_news)
* This program compares today's opening price of your chosen stock (default: Tesla) with its opening price yesterday.
* If there is a 5% difference in price between the two days, the program locates relevant news articles and formats them for ease of use.
* Articles are then sent to the user's phone via text message, along with the percent change since the previous day.
